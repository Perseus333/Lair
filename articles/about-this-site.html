        <h1>About this site</h1>
        <p>Welcome! This is my personal website. Here you will find some articles that I have written on various subjects and some other miscellaneous stuff. I don't know how consistent I will be, but I also won't put a lot of enphasis on the content.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the objectives of this website is to serve as art. I want to have many different themes for this website that reflect different design rules and break some. There will be a lot of writing to do, but I hope that you will enjoy this ever unfinnished project of mine. :)</p>
